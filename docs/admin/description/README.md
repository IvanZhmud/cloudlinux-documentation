# Description

CloudLinux OS Admin is designed for shared hosting providers who want to flawlessly migrate their 
big shared hosting customer to individual VPS with same CloudLinux features as on Shared hosting. 
At the same time you will be able to separate such a user's websites if necessary and isolate them 
with CageFS for efficient and extra security.

Also it may be suitable for a little server with less than 5 customers on it, but be careful, 
there is no migration to Shared edition available.

Most of the features of CloudLinux OS Shared are available in this edition, with a small differences:

- lve limits are set to unlimited by default (can be changed in CloudLinux Manager at any time)
- MySQL Governor is not available in this edition
- the license itself does not allow more than 5 users to be hosted on server.

:::tip Note
The CloudLinux OS Admin plan does not include the MySQL Governor
